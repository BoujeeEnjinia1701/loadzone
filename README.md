A curbside loading bay occupancy sensor that shows delivery drivers which bays are free and gives cities data on curb use.

## Concept rationale

Knowing bay availability reduces circling and double parking.

## Burning platform

Urban deliveries are growing, and curb space is among the most contested public space.

## Where it could be used

### By industry

| Industry | Use |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

### By country or region

| Country or region | Why it matters there |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

## What sparked the idea

It came out of a September 2026 review of Design Molecule's applied research areas against the open projects already in the lab.

## Problem

Delivery vehicles double-park when loading bays are occupied or unknown, blocking lanes and bike paths.

## Concept

A curbside loading bay occupancy sensor that shows delivery drivers which bays are free and gives cities data on curb use.

## Key components

- In-ground or surface magnetometer sensor
- FieldNode radio core
- Solar signage option
- Dashboard

## Safety

> Street furniture and pole mounts must be installed only with the asset owner's permission, by trained crews, with fall protection and traffic management as local rules require.

## Documentation

Controlled documents follow the portfolio [documentation standard](.kit/STANDARDS.md). Each carries a document ID (LDZ-PRC-001 for the precis), a version and a revision history. Branded PDFs are built with `python .kit/render.py` and attached to GitHub Releases when a document is tagged, for example `LDZ-PRC-001/v1.0`.
